Hello! I am Pablo Busch, a Postdoctoral Scholar in Earth System Science at Stanford and an **interdisciplinary researcher** with training in industrial and environmental engineering, public policy, energy systems, industrial ecology, and statistics. My research focuses on scientific analyses to support a **clean energy transition**, and to help identify risks to equity and sustainability in the emerging energy transition **mineral supply chain**. My main PhD work on lithium demand and supply chain was recently published on [*Nature Sustainability*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-025-01561-5), where we quantify the required lithium supply chain expansion in form of mine openings or expansions to meet different demand scenarios, showcasing the benefits of reducing lithium-ion battery size and circular economy policies in preventing mine openings.

I obtained a **PhD** in [Energy Systems](https://energy.ucdavis.edu/education/energy-graduate-group/) at UC Davis. I hold two Master of Science degrees in [Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) and in [Environmental Policy & Management](https://epm.ucdavis.edu/), both from UC Davis. My undergraduate degree is in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ing.uc.cl/) with a diploma in Environmental Engineering from the Pontific Catholic University of Chile. Prior to conducting my graduate studies, I worked for three years in environmental policy consulting in Chile, in multiple projects related to air pollution, risk analysis, life cycle assessment, circular economy, public health and climate change. I am also a proud member of the first cohort (2024-2025) of scholars for the Resources for the Future's [Critical Minerals Research Lab](https://www.rff.org/topics/transportation/critical-minerals/critical-minerals-research-lab/).

My **main research goal** is to conduct scientific analysis to diverse environmental and climate change problems, and to translate key insights from research into a digestible and actionable format for decision-making. I have worked on [scientific publications](publications.md) on policies to address cement decarbonization barriers; review of the carbon intensity of different hydrogen production pathways; modelling of the future electric vehicle supply chain; and on the empirical evidence on the effect of air quality on elderly mortality. My research is fueled by tools from engineering, statistics, geographic information systems, economics and public policy.
