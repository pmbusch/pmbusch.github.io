I am interested on the following research topics:

* Sustainability
* Energy Transition Minerals Demand & Supply Modeling
* Industrial Decarbonization
* Air Quality Health Impacts
* Data Science 

## Research Methods and Toolkit

* Tools from **Industrial Ecology** to model the flow and environmental impact of products/services across their supply chain and life stages. Main tools I use are dynamic Material Flow Analysis (**dMFA**) and Life Cycle Assessment (**LCA**).
* Engineering methods such as **Optimization** to model agent behavior and find optimal solutions towards decarbonization. My engineering background gives me a strong understanding of the physical and chemical processes that govern nature, which are key to environmental modeling.
* **Statistical methods** to handle uncertainty in modeling and forecasting, fill data gaps, pattern recognition and causality inference. I primarily use machine learning and econometric models..
* Geographic information systems (**GIS**) to incorporate spatial dimensions of environmental impacts into my models.
* **Policy analysis** to connect insights from my research into relevant, evidence-driven and actionable policy recommendations.
* All my research is powered by strong **computer programming** skills, especially in R, Python, and Julia. 

## Data and Code

I believe in transparency and reproducibility in science, so I aim for public code and data repository for all my publications. You can find most of the model code and data on my [GitHub](https://github.com/pmbusch). Please let me know if you have any questions.
